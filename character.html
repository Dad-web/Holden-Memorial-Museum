        <h1>Character Development</h1>
        <h3>A metaphor for Holden’s character is a catcher in the rye, someone who catches little kids running around fields of rye from falling off of cliffs. This shows how Holden wants to protect kids' innocence and keep them from growing up and becoming adults.</h3>

      <div class="character__writing">
        <h2>&nbsp; Individuality/Self-Isolation</h2>
        <h3>- Holden explains that he’s left and been expelled from different schools for various reasons. He narrates, “One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was surrounded by phonies” (Salinger 17).</h3>
        <p>- Holden’s individuality leads to him feeling out of touch with the world. This individuality/isolation is caused by how judgemental he is. His views and judgemental nature lead to him categorizing people based on his perception of them, such as labeling anyone who conforms to societal norms and standards a “phony.” His views cause him to be estranged from his peers and other people around him, contributing to his internal and emotional struggles. Throughout the story this affects him as he attempts to form connections with people, leading to conflicts with others.</p>
        <h2>&nbsp; Depression</h2>
        <h3>- Holden finds himself in a bar. On the walk back to the hotel from the bar, Holden starts reflecting on memories from past schools he’d gone to, which makes him feel bad as it reminds him of his emotional problems. Holden says, “I wasn't sleepy or anything, but I was feeling sort of lousy. Depressed and all. I almost wished I was dead” (Salinger 101).</h3>
        <p>- Holden’s little brother, Allie, passed away due to cancer before the events of the book took place. He harbors a lot of untreated grief for his late brother, leading to many of his emotional struggles with feelings of depression. This causes him to have difficulty in social situations, which is why he feels as though everyone around him is a phony, because he doesn’t understand why people reject the way he talks and thinks. His depression leads to other issues like isolation, a negative outlook on life, his loss of innocence, and his inability to cope with life’s struggles. He doesn’t speak of his depression a lot, but there are certain times while he reflects on his past where he remembers the injustice of Allie’s early passing that makes him feel bad. A lot of his mistreatment and misjudgment of others also stems from his grief, affecting his relationships, worldview, and ability to find happiness in his life.</p>
        <h2>Alienation</h2>
        <h3>Holden’s character leads to the development of a theme of alienation. His isolation from society as well as his judgemental nature lead to his tendency to mark people as phonies. He struggles to find his place in society because of this. Holden’s emotional journey through the book also shows his deep sense of alienation, coupled with and amplified by his grief and his desire to preserve his innocence through rejection of society. His longing to keep his innocence is a part of what leads to his judgment of others, making him feel as though there is no place where he belongs.</h3>
