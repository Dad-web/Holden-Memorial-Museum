            <h1>Archetype: Loss of Innocence</h1>
            <h2>&nbsp;Loss of Innocence Explained</h2>
            <h3>The loss of innocence is a common theme in literature. It symbolizes the transition between a character’s innocence and naivety to the more complex and harsher realities of adulthood. In the initial stage, the character is typically depicted as unaware of the darker aspects of life. The character then experiences an event that shatters their childish views. Once the character encounters reality, they face internal struggles because they feel conflicted with their new perspective. Finally, the character gradually accepts the new reality and has a more mature perspective.</h3>
            <h2>Supporting Quotes</h2>
            <h3>"You'd have liked [Allie]. He was two years younger than I was, but he was about fifty times as intelligent" (Salinger 38).</h3>
            <p>&nbsp; - &nbsp;Holden loses his innocence when his brother, and one of his best friends, Allie dies. Before this event, Holden’s life is relatively carefree and stable but the sudden loss of his brother introduces him to the harsh reality of life. He realizes that most things in life are not permanent, impacting his ability to make meaningful connections with other people. This quote shows Holden’s deep admiration for Allie and it significantly contrasts with Holden’s descriptions of the other people in his life, showing that it was Allie’s death that led to his judgmental nature and his constant criticism of others. This loss is one of the first major changes in Holden’s life and is what causes him to lose his innocent view of the world and start looking at it through a more mature lens.</p>
            <h3>“That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all” (Salinger 191).</h3>
            <p>&nbsp; - &nbsp;Holden’s dream of being the “catcher in the rye” signifies his rejection of having lost his innocence because he has a desire to protect other children from the same fate. He refuses to accept the harsh reality of the world and instead envisions himself standing in a field of rye, catching children before they fall off a cliff. The cliff metaphorically represents falling into the “phony” world of adulthood and losing one’s innocence. Holden wants to protect all the children from doing that because of the pain and disillusionment that he has endured since he lost his innocence.</p>
            <h2>Symbols of Stages of Loss of Innocence in the Novel</h2>
            <h3>Explanation of each image:</h3>
            <p>1.) The baseball mitt is symbolic of the start of the loss of innocence stages, where the world is peaceful. This is because Allie had a baseball mitt with quotes and sayings written all over it, so it is a symbol that represents his character.</p>
            <p>2.) The skull shows the next stage of loss of innocence-- shock/betrayal. The skull symbolizes Allie's death because that is what started Holden's loss of innocence.</p>
            <p>3.) The red hunting hat shows a stage of chaos and struggles for Holden as he grappled with his complex emotional problems while living on his own in NYC with his untreated grief for Allie.</p>
            <p>4.) The catcher in the rye is symbolic of a stage where Holden's beliefs start to shift, because he realizes that he wants to protect other people from going through the same things he had to and doesn't want other kids to have to mature in the way he was forced to with the death of his brother.</p>
            <p>5.) The carousel is symbolic of the last stage of loss of innocence, where Holden comes to terms with his grief and emotions and finds that, through his little sister Phoebe, he can still enjoy and live his life to its fullest.</p>
