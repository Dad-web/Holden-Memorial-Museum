            <h1>Loneliness</h1>
            <h2>Supporting Quotes</h2>
            <h3>1.) &nbsp;After Holden tells Phoebe he is moving to the West and starting his life over, Phoebe meets Holden in front of a museum with a suitcase in her hand and tells Holden that she has the suitcase because she is going with him. Holden responds to Phoebe by saying, “ ‘You can't take anything. Because you're not going. I'm going alone. So shut up’ ’” (Salinger 227).</h3>
            <h3>2.) &nbsp;Holden gets in a cab so he can stay at a hotel In New York City that is away from his family’s house and he starts making conversation with the driver. After just a few minutes of knowing the cab driver, Holden asks him,  "Would you care to stop on the way and join me for a cocktail?” (Salinger 68).</h3>
            <h2>Motif Explanation</h2>
            <h3>Loneliness plays a major role in showing how Holden constantly seeks attention from strangers or people that he thinks are phony. Even though he doesn’t have many close friends, he still tries to connect with people but every time he does, he ends up lonelier and more miserable than before because he pushes them away. These quotes show how Holden isolates himself from his close friends or family and tries to fill that gap by making meaningless conversations with people he considers phonies. Throughout the novel, Holden’s tendency to push people away when he gets close to them and his constant attempts to engage with strangers leads him to become isolated and not understand genuine connections with others. This loneliness leads to other issues such as his depression and how judgemental he is of other people.</h3>
