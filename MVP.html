            <h2>Quotes + Explanation</h2>
            <h3>“About halfway to the bathroom, I sort of started pretending I had a bullet in my guts. Old Maurice had plugged me. Now I was on the way to the bathroom to get a good shot of bourbon or something to steady my nerves and help me really go into action. I pictured myself coming out of the goddam bathroom, dressed and all, with my automatic in my pocket, and staggering around a little bit” (Salinger 116).</h2>
            <h3>“When I was really drunk, I started that stupid business with the bullet in my guts again. I was the only guy at the bar with a bullet in their guts. I kept putting my hand under my jacket, on my stomach and all, to keep the blood from dripping all over the place” (Salinger 166).</h2>
            <p>- &nbsp;These quotes reveal that, while Holden prefers to act tough and cold, he's still just a teenager who likes to kid around and play pretend. These two quotes are interesting because they contrast most of what Holden usually says about how tough he is and how depressed he is, and they show him having fun trying to conceal his "wounds" and role-playing that he's in some mystery, thriller movie.</p>
